-----------------------------------

The goal of this assignment is two fold. 
First, we seek to utilize our lecture notes 
from lecture 10 and implement a parallel 
matrix-matrix multiplication kernel.  
Second, we seek to observe the performance 
differences depending upon where the directives 
are implemented.  

The source directory contains several files
- main.c : driver
- dgemm_seq.c : sequential DGEMM
- dgemm_l1.c : L1 parallel solver
- dgemm_l2.c : L2 parallel solver 
- dgemm_l3.c : L3 parallel solver

For each of the {L1,L2,L3} parallel solvers, 
implement the necessary OpenMP clauses on 
the 1st, 2nd and 3rd loop nests, respectively.
Make sure that the private and shared data 
variables are correctly specified.

Execute the sequential version (dgemm_seq) 
and record the timing and performance.
Execute each of the parallel versions 
using 1-8 threads and record the timing 
and performance for each.  The driver 
will print the timing and the performance.

Use the included makefile to build the 
different versions.  (Just type 'make').
